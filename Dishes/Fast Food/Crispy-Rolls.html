        <h2>Rolls</h2>

        <strong>Crispy roll</strong>
        <i><p>A Crispy Roll is a popular appetizer or snack that typically consists of a thin and crispy outer layer wrapped around a filling of vegetables, meat, or seafood. The filling can vary depending on personal preference and regional cuisines. Common fillings include finely chopped vegetables like cabbage, carrots, and onions, along with seasoned ground meat or shrimp. The roll is then deep-fried or baked until the outer layer becomes golden and crispy. Crispy rolls are often served with dipping sauces like sweet chili sauce or soy sauce, adding an extra burst of flavor to each bite. They are enjoyed for their satisfying crunch and the combination of flavors from the filling and the crispy shell.</p></i>
