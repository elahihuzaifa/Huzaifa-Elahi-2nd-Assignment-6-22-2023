        <strong>Crispy Broast</strong>

The chicken pieces, typically marinated in a seasoned mixture of spices and sometimes buttermilk, are coated in a seasoned batter or breading. They are then deep-fried until golden brown and crispy, resulting in a deliciously crunchy exterior. Crispy Broast is often served with a side of fries or coleslaw, offering a satisfying and indulgent fried chicken experience.</p></i>
